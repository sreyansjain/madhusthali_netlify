<h3 id="daily-morning-prayer">Daily Morning Prayer</h3>

<p>O, Father give me prosperity, health and wisdom, without measure, not from
earthly sources, but from your all possessing, all powerful and all bountiful
hands. Help me to think the right thing, to speak the right
thing and to do the right thing.
Keep me free from anger, hatred, greed and all other vices. Bless my parents,
my brothers and sisters, my friends and foes and all those around me.
Bless my country and my countrymen and all the humans around the world.
Fill this school with Your ocean of love and surround our teachers and all
others with Your radiant light. Guide my actions so that I may not
cause any harm to others.
Shower your blessings on all those benevolent souls, who left no stones
unturned to make this school what it is.</p>

<h3 id="daily-evening-prayer">Daily Evening Prayer</h3>

<p>Father we thank Three for the night,
And for the pleasant morning light,
For rest and food and loving care,
And all that makes the world so fair.
Help us to do the things we should,
To be to others kind and good,
In all we do, in work and play
To grow more loving and caring every day.
Dear Father in heaven, look down from above,
And bless our parents, sisters and brothers,
And all the teachers and those who do not teach,
And toil hard to make our lives easy and cosy,
And all whom we love and those who need you.
Father in heaven, hear and bless thy beasts
And the birds that fly in the air and sing
Bless all the crops and the croppers and all Thy glory,
Other weeds, shrubs, plants and trees
That we need for life and beauty,
As we retire for the night, let your angels
Watch over us so that we may sleep in peace
And in safety and not having a care
In this vast and not stormy world.
When the morning breaks, wake us all up
Sans fatigue and with renewed strengh
And keep us protected, the whole day through.</p>
