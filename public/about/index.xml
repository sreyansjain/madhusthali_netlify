      <description>Daily Morning Prayer O, Father give me prosperity, health and wisdom, without measure, not from earthly sources, but from your all possessing, all powerful and all bountiful hands. Help me to think the right thing, to speak the right thing and to do the right thing. Keep me free from anger, hatred, greed and all other vices. Bless my parents, my brothers and sisters, my friends and foes and all those around me.</description>
