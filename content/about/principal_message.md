Starting the struggle of life at a very early stage, I have traversed
the tough road to success through myriad experiences and
experiments. In the quest for success, I ventured into many
enterprises, some of which met with huge success while others were
moderate. Through these enterprises, I have come across thousands of
people, a few successful and still rising on the path of success, and
others merely dragging on with their lives. In my interactions with
them, I found that the biggest lagging was in the basic
education. While people went through their education merely passing
exams for degrees, they lacked in the basic skills of effective
communication, arithmetic and over all personality development.

Choosing the right school for a child is a very critical decision for
every parent because on it depends the future of the child. We at
Madhusthali Vidyapeeth equip our students with the resources to make
the right choices in a world where knowledge expands in gigantic
proportions. Our strong academic thrust, embedded in universal values,
empowers our students to become winners from the very outset. My aim
is to provide an ambience to students that foster leadership and
accountability.
