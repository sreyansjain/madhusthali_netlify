### SCHOOL CURRICULUM

Madhusthali Vidyapeeth follows the ICSE Curriculum which was earlier popularly called The Cambridge Board Exam. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations administers the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (ICSE). The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate established the Council in 1958. The ICSE Examination has been designed to provide a course of general education in accordance with the recommendations of the New Education Policy 1986. Students who follow it take certain compulsory subjects and also select subjects of interest to them from a range of choices. Socially Useful and Productive Work and Community Service play an important part in the programme. Classes X students take the ICSE Examinations in March - April. The School assesses the Socially Useful and Productive Work and Community Service and the result will count towards the award of the Certificate.

### PRIMARY KG TO V

Years spent in primary school have been recognized as the most crucial phase in the development of a child. Long-term academic success and achievement results from factors in the primary setting. We at Madhusthali, therefore strive to ensure an environment that lends itself to student achievement providing optimal conditions for student development. The curriculum for Classes KG to V is based on the ICSE guidelines, which allows enough room to address individual needs and to create a learner-centered classroom – one of the strengths of the ICSE curriculum – while introducing skills, concepts and information which will lay a strong foundation for the secondary level.
The academic year is divided into two semesters with exams at the end of each. Teachers can, however, monitor a student’s development throughout the academic year by assessing projects, worksheets, and various class work and homework assignments. This emphasis on internal assessment continues in the secondary stage.
At the primary level there is a notable increase in the demand for higher levels of verbal reasoning and written communication skills. In the language classroom care is taken to ensure that students recognize speaking, listening, reading and writing as active, constructive processes. They are encouraged to summarize ideas and state their own views. They also learn to consciously attend to the rules of the written language to ensure that sentences are complete, interesting and connected to each other.
Every student is also assigned to be a member of a House and c
an participate in extra curricular activities with the four Houses as basic units in competitive activities. This gives them an opportunity to interact with different age groups and also helps to develop their organizational and leadership qualities. Participation in the ECAs helps to instill discipline and nurtures a cooperative attitude, sensitivity to others and the ability to work in a team for achieving common goals. The Primary curriculum is designed to enable learners to step over the threshold of secondary school with confidence and eagerness.
