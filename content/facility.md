### STUDENT COUNSELING

The purpose of counseling is to improve the lives of children suffering from any sort of learning disorder or the inability to cope with the constantly changing world around them. During the early years a growing child may face problems in the classroom, playground and even at home. There is peer pressure, social and familial pressure, even sibling pressure! The child may easily buckle under any or all of these pressures. The problem is compounded if the child has few friends or is unable to unburden himself to someone close to him/her If unaddressed these small issues become emotional, psychological or social problems. To address these issues the school has a School Counselor who helps the child to deal with his/her academic or emotional problems.
